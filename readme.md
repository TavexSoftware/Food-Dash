# Food-Dash
## The new food ordering system
<br />
<br />

## About
Our dev's spent a long time inside during lockdown and we realised how hard it is for some people. So we came up with foodDASH. A new way to order food! Using ethier our web app, desktop app or even our mobile app you can esaly order food! Enjoy!

## Where's The Mac Edition?
Curently we are working hard on a mac rellease. Since windows is the most used OS we have decided to start with that. Our members have much better knowledge with C and C# than other stuff. (And how can we get this to work with python anyway?)
<br />
We are expanding our Dev team and we hope to get it finished soon ;)
